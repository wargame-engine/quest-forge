# Character Creation

Characters in Quest Forge can be created in a multitude of ways and are not bound to any particular class system
in order to allow for maximum customization. Characters will usually start a first level, with a small selection
of attribute points to assign and a number of feat points to purchase special abilities.

## Character Description

The beginning of any great RPG character is a concept. This can be anything from a vampire hunter to a power armor wearing
super-solider depending on the setting being played. Your imagination is the limit and you'll be provided many opportunities
to bring your character to life through various game mechanics described later on.

**Name** - Choose an appropriate name for your character that fits into the world you and your GM have decided to enjoy.

**Appearance** - You will want to have some character appearance in mind when creating your character. Feel free to use a
reference photo or other material to imagine your character. This will cover both your character's size, shape and other
physical attributes that would allow other people to recognize them and how they might interact with the world.

**Background** - Choose a background for your character.
