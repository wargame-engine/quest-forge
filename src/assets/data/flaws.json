  "flaws": {
    "Absent-minded": "Your live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.",
    "Addiction": "The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you've got an itch that you need to scratch, and you'll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.",
    "Ambitious": "You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it's typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.",
    "Bloodlust": "Battle isn't just a way of life, it is <em>the<\/em> way of life. There isn't a conflict you've encountered that wasn't best solved with steel, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren't necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.",
    "Brash": "You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a bit of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.",
    "Bravado": "You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.",
    "Cosmetic Deformity": "Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.",
    "Compulsion": "You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.",
    "Cowardly": "You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harms way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.",
    "Dimwitted": "You aren't the sharpest tack in the box. It's not just that you weren't gifted with skill in academia, it's that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.",
    "Disabled": "You have some physical deficiency that holds you back in life. You decide the nature and severity of your disability. Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.",
    "Greedy": "You can't help it: you just like things. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you'll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You're easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.",
    "Honest": "You won't tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.",
    "Hot Tempered": "Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive. Sometimes your anger boils slowly over time and other times it erupts completely unexpectedly. But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.",
    "Illiterate": "You can't read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.",
    "Literal Minded": "You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is \u201craining cats and dogs\u201d. If a friend exaggerated by saying \u201cI'd kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice\u201d, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend's life if Melzak did get elected.",
    "Mood Disorder": "You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety. You get to to determine the nature and severity of your mood disorder.",
    "Naive": "Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you're a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.",
    "Overt": "You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.",
    "Overweight": "You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.",
    "Pacifist": "You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won't lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.",
    "Phobia": "You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence, a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.",
    "Proud": "Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you're not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Star Force leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.",
    "Psychotic": "You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality. You get to determine the extent and nature of your psychosis, including any potential triggers. For example, you might believe that beings from another dimension are trying to abduct you, or perhaps you relive a nightmarish scene from your past whenever you are in the midst of a gun fight.",
    "Short-winded": "You have poor lung capacity and easily tire. Sprints, long runs, and forced marches are either impossible for you or they tend to leave you completely incapacitated afterwards.",
    "Sick": "You suffer from some sort of chronic illness or condition, such as tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis, or irritable bowel syndrome. Even if you possess the means to treat your disease or control the symptoms, you might still have episodes or flare ups that hinder your adventuring life.",
    "Socially Awkward": "Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don't respect the personal space of others, you tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.",
    "Stubborn": "It's your way or the highway. Maybe not all of the time, but once you've made your mind up on an important matter, you won't budge. You probably won't even compromise.",
    "Uncoordinated": "Your body just doesn't work well with itself. You have trouble balancing, catching, throwing, and performing similar physical tasks that require dexterity or nimbleness.",
    "Vengeful": "You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out.",
    "Zealous": "You stand for a cause - whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise - and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause."
